XLSX Writer for OpenEdge ABL

This is a class libary for OpenEdge ABL which enables the devloper to create a XLSX document within the ABL. It intended disign 
is to be platform independant meaning it does not require Microsoft Office installed.

The orignal code was within in python and I'm slowly converting it into ABL.

This project is in its infancy and should not be used in production enviorment.

Currently there is no documentation but there is a sample demo code to call the class libary.
